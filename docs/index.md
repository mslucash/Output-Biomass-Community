# What is the Biomass Community Output Extension?

This extension generates new initial community inputs (text file and map) at specified time steps. These are output in the format:  species age (biomass).  Biomass will be in g / m2.  The purpose of the extension is to create a new initial community input file from a model run, allowing a user to 'restart' a model run from a given time point by inputting this output.
